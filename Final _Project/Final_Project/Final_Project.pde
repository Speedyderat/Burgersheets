/* This program has been written by Jasper Bosschart (s2562685) & Marina Stefanova (s2610604) and is the final assignemtn from module 4 CreaTe 2021 */

//Our final project is an Air Hockey game with an introduction and a winning screen. 
//The project is created with knowledge we gained during the assignments we did this module, and during previous modules. 
//We also used examples from Daniel Shiffmanâ€™s The Nature of Code and a simple air hockey game that we took inspiration from, but made our own.
